JR Why would I have an agent when I can directly use the tool or call the API?

What is the difference between MCPServerStdio and FastMCP ?

Have you come across an Al application in which you feed it database schema catalog and either Al will extract data to answer your questions &/or generate SQL code that will provide the answer? This will be a very attractive application, especially if collaborated with data analytics (based from the data being extracted).

Can agent exist without MCP server? How will it look in that case?

If the host has more than one server that does a similar action, how does the lim determine which server to contact?

Can you please explain on how prompts are user controlled? How are they different from resources when you use an @ symbol for resources and // for prompt?

When you say LLM executes the Tool, is it really thats how it works or MCP server executes wherever it is and provides output to LLM to consume?

There are loads of Jira DC APls available. But I want to expose only few to LLM and not all of them. How I can write MCP server without writing separate tool for each API so that I can couple it with LLM?

Is there a use-case where an LLM will access the MCP-server directly (such as a third party MCP-server hosted in the cloud). Or must it always be via the host? 07:03 pm
