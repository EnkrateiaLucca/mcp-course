# Generated Scripts

This directory contains automation scripts generated by the Automation Agent.

## About

When you run `automation_agent.py` and request an automation script, the agent will:

1. Query the automation database via MCP
2. Retrieve the appropriate script template
3. Write the script to this directory
4. Make it executable (for bash scripts)
5. Provide usage instructions

## Example

```bash
# After running the agent and requesting a backup script:
$ ls
backup_files.sh          # Generated bash script
organize_downloads.py    # Generated Python script
monitor_disk_space.py    # Generated Python script
```

## Running Generated Scripts

### Bash Scripts (.sh)

```bash
# Make executable (if not already)
chmod +x backup_files.sh

# Run with arguments
./backup_files.sh /source/path /backup/path
```

### Python Scripts (.py)

```bash
# Run with Python
python organize_downloads.py ~/Downloads

# Or with UV
uv run organize_downloads.py ~/Downloads
```

## Safety

- Scripts in this directory were generated automatically
- Always review scripts before running them
- Test with non-critical data first
- Understand what each script does before execution

## Contents

This directory starts empty. Scripts are created on-demand by the agent based on user requests.
