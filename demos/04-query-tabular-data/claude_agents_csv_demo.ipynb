    "# Claude Agents SDK with Custom MCP Server for CSV Querying\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use **Claude Agents SDK** with a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to query data from a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the Claude Agents SDK?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Claude Agents SDK** is Anthropic's official Python framework for building production AI agents that can:\n",
    "- Execute tools and commands autonomously\n",
    "- Read and edit files\n",
    "- Search the web\n",
    "- Integrate with MCP servers for custom capabilities\n",
    "- Manage multi-turn conversations with built-in context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features:**\n",
    "- Simple `query()` function for stateless interactions\n",
    "- `ClaudeSDKClient` for stateful conversations\n",
    "- Native MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration\n",
    "- Support for both local (stdio) and remote (HTTP) MCP servers\n",
    "- Built-in streaming responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### MCP (Model Context Protocol)\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP is an open standard introduced by Anthropic that standardizes how AI models interact with external tools and data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transport Types:**\n",
    "- **stdio** - Local subprocess communication (what we'll use here)\n",
    "- **HTTP/SSE** - Remote server communication (for deployed services)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we'll:\n",
    "1. Use the existing CSV MCP server that provides tools to query product data\n",
    "2. Connect to it using stdio transport (local subprocess)\n",
    "3. Use Claude Agents SDK to interact with the data naturally through conversation"

    "## How It Works: Behind the Scenes\n",
    "\n",
    "### MCP Protocol Flow with Claude Agents SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a query:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Server Initialization**\n",
    "   - SDK reads the `mcp_servers` configuration from `ClaudeAgentOptions`\n",
    "   - Launches `csv_query_mcp_server.py` as a subprocess\n",
    "   - Establishes stdin/stdout communication pipes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tool Discovery**\n",
    "   - SDK calls the MCP `tools/list` endpoint\n",
    "   - Server returns all available tools with their schemas\n",
    "   - Tools are namespaced as `mcp__csv-query__tool_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Agent Reasoning**\n",
    "   - User query is sent to Claude (via Anthropic API)\n",
    "   - Claude sees the available tools in its context\n",
    "   - Claude decides which tool(s) to call based on the query\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tool Execution**\n",
    "   - SDK sends tool call request to MCP server via `tools/call`\n",
    "   - Server executes the tool (e.g., queries the CSV)\n",
    "   - Results are returned through the pipe\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Response Generation**\n",
    "   - Tool results are added to the conversation context\n",
    "   - Claude generates a natural language response\n",
    "   - Final output is streamed through the async generator\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**query() Function:**\n",
    "- Stateless, one-shot interactions\n",
    "- Returns an async generator of messages\n",
    "- Automatically handles the agent loop (tool calls + responses)\n",
    "\n",
    "**ClaudeAgentOptions:**\n",
    "- Configures model, system prompt, tools, and MCP servers\n",
    "- `permission_mode` controls tool approval:\n",
    "  - `\"default\"` - asks for permission\n",
    "  - `\"bypassPermissions\"` - auto-approves all\n",
    "  - `\"acceptEdits\"` - auto-approves edits only\n",
    "\n",
    "**Message Types:**\n",
    "- `AssistantMessage` - Contains Claude's response and tool uses\n",
    "- `TextBlock` - Text content from Claude\n",
    "- `ToolUseBlock` - Tool call information\n",
    "- `ResultMessage` - Final result with cost and metadata"
