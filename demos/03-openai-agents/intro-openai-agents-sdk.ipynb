      "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open, vendor-neutral specification introduced by Anthropic in late 2024 that standardizes how large language models connect to external tools, files, databases and services via a client–server architecture—effectively solving the “N × M” integration problem by enabling one integration per tool that any compliant model can use. ([theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305774/anthropic-model-context-protocol-data-sources?utm_source=openai)) By defining a common interface, SDKs, and server patterns, MCP accelerates interoperability for agentic assistants, enterprise copilots, IDE integrations and multi-tool workflows, making it easier for developers to build reusable, plug‑and‑play connectors. ([modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/changelog?utm_source=openai)) That relevance is amplified by growing industry interest and endorsements from major platform players pursuing an “agentic” future for AI. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-wants-ai-agents-work-together-remember-things-2025-05-19/?utm_source=openai)) At the same time, empirical research and reporting have flagged real security and maintainability risks—prompt injection, tool‑poisoning, identity/credential fragmentation and other MCP‑specific attack patterns—so organizations adopting MCP should pair interoperability benefits with careful authorization, identity and server‑hardening practices.
