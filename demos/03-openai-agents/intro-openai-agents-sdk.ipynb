      "The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic on November 25, 2024, is an open‑source, model‑agnostic client–server standard that lets large language models access external files, services, and tools via a JSON‑RPC‑style interface (stdio/HTTP transports) to solve the “N×M” integration problem and standardize how models receive contextual data. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol?utm_source=openai)) Because MCP is permissively licensed and shipped with SDKs and reference servers, a quickly growing ecosystem (IDEs, agent frameworks, cloud services and enterprise connectors) has emerged and major vendors such as OpenAI, Microsoft and Google/DeepMind have announced support—making MCP a practical interoperability layer across models and platforms. ([developers.openai.com](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp/?utm_source=openai)) Its relevance is therefore high for developers and organizations that want reusable, “ship‑once” connectors and richer real‑time context for agents, but researchers and security commentators have also flagged MCP‑specific risks (e.g., prompt‑injection, identity‑fragmentation and tool‑poisoning), prompting calls for MCP‑aware security practices and scanning tools.
