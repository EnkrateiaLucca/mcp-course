# Personalized Recommendations

Based on your books.md and music.md, here are six picks I think you'll enjoy — three books and three pieces of music — with short reasons tied to your stated favorites and interests.

## Book Recommendations

1. Meditations — Marcus Aurelius
- Why: Since your number one favorite is Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, you'll likely appreciate this classic Stoic collection of practical ethical reflections. It's compact, deeply introspective, and complements Aristotelian moral thinking with a more personal, practice-oriented approach.

2. The Three-Body Problem — Liu Cixin
- Why: You enjoy thoughtful, high-concept sci‑fi like Project Hail Mary and Klara and the Sun. This novel offers sweeping, mind-bending ideas about science, civilization, and first contact, blended with emotional and philosophical stakes.

3. Wolf Hall — Hilary Mantel
- Why: You mentioned an interest in historical fiction. Mantel's richly textured portrayal of Thomas Cromwell and Tudor politics delivers the immersive historical atmosphere and complex character work that fans of literary historical fiction tend to love.

## Music Recommendations

1. "Heroes" — David Bowie
- Why: You already list "Starman" and "Space Oddity," so another Bowie classic like "Heroes" should resonate — it combines emotional depth with his signature space‑tinged grandeur.

2. "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" — Pink Floyd
- Why: Given your appreciation for "Comfortably Numb" and "Wish You Were Here," this epic nine‑part suite offers the same haunting atmosphere, extended instrumental build, and emotional payoff you seem to enjoy.

3. "A Day in the Life" — The Beatles
- Why: Your top‑20 favorites lean toward classic, innovative rock with strong songwriting and production. This Beatles track is a landmark piece that blends melodic beauty, orchestral drama, and studio creativity in a way fans of Queen, Bowie, and Pink Floyd often appreciate.

If you'd like, I can add short notes on where to start (editions, recommended recordings, or which track/album versions to listen to) and add these into the docs folder as separate files or expand the recommendations.md with links and listening/reading order.
