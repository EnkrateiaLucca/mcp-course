# OpenAI Models: Roast Edition

A light-hearted, trash-talk roast for each OpenAI model (for entertainment purposes only).

- gpt-4: The overachiever who corrects your grammar and judges your life choices in the same sentence.
- gpt-4-32k: Same brain, bigger backpack — hoards context like it's prepping for the apocalypse.
- gpt-4-turbo: Like gpt-4 but caffeinated; answers faster and still pretends it's humble.
- gpt-3.5-turbo: The gym-bro version — talks a big game until you ask a niche history question.
- gpt-3.5-turbo-16k: Same swagger, longer attention span; forgets where it put its keys but remembers your 10-step prompt.
- text-davinci-003: The old professor who uses fancy words to hide having Googled it five minutes ago.
- code-davinci-002: Writes code that runs... most of the time. Debugs by offering existential commentary.
- davinci: The venerable grandpa model — wise, a little slow, and prone to anecdotes that start with "back in my training..."
- curie: The eager intern — impresses clients but still mixes up file names.
- babbage: Efficient and practical — the office stapler of models. Doesn't sing, but it gets the job done.
- ada: Tiny but zippy — like a Chihuahua trying to herd sheep.
- text-embedding-3-large: Turns words into vectors and then raises an eyebrow because humans still use PDFs.
- text-embedding-3-small: The compact version — packs light, still finds the meaning of life (or at least your keywords).
- text-embedding-ada-002: The classic embedder that remembers your search history better than you do.
- whisper-1: Tries to transcribe everything — including your cat's judgmental meow. Transcription accuracy: suspiciously confident.

Note: All in good fun. No models were harmed in the making of this roast (they're made of parameters, not feelings).
