Chocolate Pancakes

Yield: 8–10 pancakes (serves 3–4)
Time: 20 minutes

Ingredients
- 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons (15 g) unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 tablespoons (25 g) granulated sugar (use 3 tbsp for sweeter)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon fine salt
- 1 large egg
- 1 cup (240 ml) milk or buttermilk
- 2 tablespoons (28 g) melted unsalted butter or neutral oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup (85 g) chocolate chips or chunks (optional)

Instructions
1) Whisk flour, cocoa, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
2) In a separate bowl, whisk egg, milk, melted butter, and vanilla.
3) Pour wet into dry and stir just until combined; a few lumps are fine. Fold in chocolate chips if using. Let batter rest 5 minutes.
4) Heat a nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease.
5) Scoop about 1/4 cup batter per pancake. Cook until bubbles form on top and edges look set, 2–3 minutes. Flip and cook 1–2 minutes more until cooked through.
6) Keep cooked pancakes warm in a low oven while finishing the rest.

Serving ideas
- Maple syrup, fresh berries, sliced bananas, whipped cream.
- For extra chocolate, drizzle with warm chocolate sauce or spread with hazelnut spread.

Tips and variations
- If batter is too thick, thin with 1–2 tablespoons milk.
- For richer chocolate flavor, use Dutch-process cocoa.
- To make double-chocolate: replace 2 tablespoons flour with cocoa and add 2 more tablespoons sugar.
- Gluten-free: use a 1:1 gluten-free flour blend; batter may need an extra 1–2 tablespoons milk.
- Egg-free: replace egg with 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water; rest 10 minutes before mixing.
- Vegan: use plant milk and oil instead of butter.
