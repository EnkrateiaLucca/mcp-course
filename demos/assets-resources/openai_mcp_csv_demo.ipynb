    "# OpenAI Agents SDK with Custom MCP Server for CSV Querying\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use OpenAI's Agents SDK with a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to query data from a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the OpenAI Responses API?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Responses API** is OpenAI's newest and most advanced API (released March 2025) that combines the strengths of:\n",
    "- **Chat Completions API** - For conversational interactions\n",
    "- **Assistants API** - For stateful, multi-turn conversations with tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "- Stateful conversations with automatic context management\n",
    "- Built-in tool support (file search, web search, code interpreter)\n",
    "- Native MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration\n",
    "- Support for remote and local MCP servers\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenAI Agents SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Agents SDK** is a Python framework built on top of the Responses API that provides:\n",
    "- Easy agent creation and orchestration\n",
    "- Simple integration with MCP servers via stdio transport\n",
    "- Automatic tool discovery and execution\n",
    "- Multi-agent workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### MCP (Model Context Protocol)\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP is an open standard (introduced by Anthropic, adopted by OpenAI in March 2025) that standardizes how AI models interact with external tools and data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transport Types:**\n",
    "- **stdio** - Local subprocess communication (what we'll use here)\n",
    "- **HTTP/SSE** - Remote server communication (for deployed services)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we'll:\n",
    "1. Create a custom MCP server that provides tools to query CSV data\n",
    "2. Connect to it using stdio transport (local subprocess)\n",
    "3. Use OpenAI's Agents SDK to interact with the data naturally through conversation"

    "## How It Works: Behind the Scenes\n",
    "\n",
    "### MCP Protocol Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Server Initialization**\n",
    "   - `MCPServerStdio` launches `csv_query_mcp_server.py` as a subprocess\n",
    "   - Communication pipes (stdin/stdout) are established\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tool Discovery**\n",
    "   - The SDK calls the MCP `tools/list` endpoint\n",
    "   - The server returns all available tools with their schemas\n",
    "   - This information is cached in an `mcp_list_tools` context item\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Agent Reasoning**\n",
    "   - User query is sent to the OpenAI model (via Responses API)\n",
    "   - Model sees the available tools in its context\n",
    "   - Model decides which tool(s) to call based on the query\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tool Execution**\n",
    "   - SDK sends tool call request to MCP server via `tools/call`\n",
    "   - Server executes the tool (e.g., queries the CSV)\n",
    "   - Results are returned through the pipe\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Response Generation**\n",
    "   - Tool results are added to the conversation context\n",
    "   - Model generates a natural language response\n",
    "   - Final output is returned to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "### Responses API vs. Agents SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "**Responses API (Direct):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Direct API call (for remote MCP servers)\n",
    "response = client.responses.create(\n",
    "    model=\"gpt-4o\",\n",

    "    }],\n",
    "    input=\"Your query\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "    )\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standardization** - One protocol for all tool integrations\n",
    "2. **Simplicity** - Decorator-based tool creation with FastMCP\n",
    "3. **Flexibility** - Works locally (stdio) or remotely (HTTP/SSE)\n",
    "4. **Composability** - Combine multiple MCP servers in one agent\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use stdio vs. HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "**stdio (Local)**:\n",
    "- Development and testing\n",
    "- Single-user applications\n",
    "- No network required\n",
    "- Process isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "**HTTP/SSE (Remote)**:\n",
    "- Production deployments\n",
    "- Multi-user services\n",
    "- Centralized tool management\n",
    "- Cross-network access\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool Design**\n",
    "   - Keep tools focused and single-purpose\n",
    "   - Provide clear descriptions for the model\n",
    "   - Return structured, parseable data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Handling**\n",
    "   - Return meaningful error messages\n",
    "   - Handle edge cases gracefully\n",
    "   - Validate inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance**\n",
    "   - Use tool filtering when possible\n",
    "   - Cache expensive operations\n",
    "   - Optimize data queries\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Security**\n",
    "   - Validate and sanitize inputs\n",
    "   - Limit file system access\n",
    "   - Use appropriate authentication for remote servers"
